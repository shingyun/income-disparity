            <p>In 2016, how was the income distributed in the United States? Many higher-income counties are located in Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and California State. While many counties in Virginia have a median household income above the national average, this hides the fact that Virginia has the largest income gap between the lowest-income county and highest-income county of any state. Almost all counties in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Hawaii have an income above average. Counties with relatively low income are mostly in middle-south of the US. <br>Hover over circles to see more details.<br><p class = 'source'>Source: median household income data from American Community Sruvey</p>
